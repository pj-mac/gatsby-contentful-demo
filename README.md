# Demonstration of a Gatsby-Contentful website

This is an example of using Gatsby and Contentful to build a basic starter website.

## Demo Site

### ðŸ‘‰ [https://pjmac.netlify.app/](https://pjmac.netlify.app/)

## What's included

- React
- Gatsby
- TypeScript
- ESLint
- Unit Testing (Jest)
- Tailwind CSS and PostCSS
- Heroicons

The homepage is generated using `src/pages/index.tsx`. Individual pages are created using `gatsby-node.ts` and `src/templates/ProfilePageTemplate.tsx`.

## Building locally

Create an `.env` file to store environment variables. You can also create one per environment, such as `.env.development` and  `.env.production`. Then copy the contents of `_env.sample` and paste it into the new file(s). Add the values (obtained from Contentful) to variables CONTENTFUL_SPACE_ID and CONTENTFUL_ACCESS_TOKEN.

Run `npm install` to install dependencies.

If using VS Code, install the following extensions:

- ESLint
